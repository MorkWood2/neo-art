  <p>Graffiti is a glimpse into the life of an artist, one that is often not recognized, has no face, nor museum exhibits. They leave in the dead of night, there are no rules, the only thing between them and the wall is the flashing lights of a police car, otherwise the world is their canvas. Graf<span class="blue">¬∑</span>fi<span class="red">¬∑</span>ti a term rooted in the word <i>graffio</i> or ‚Äòa scratch‚Äô, it‚Äôs a nice euphemism to explain the phenomenon of someone who works a graveyard shift while not getting paid,  in an environment fueled by adrenaline, which often presents dangers such as detainment and death. The only reason someone would do such a thing is simple. They love what they do.   </p>

   The self awareness of this irony is killing me . . .
  </div>

  <p>It‚Äôs a game of cat and mouse. Get caught, spend 100 hours in community service or five years in a state prison. Run free and you can relish in the thought of what you just created. If you're good enough it can stay for sometime, or in some cases make the landlords some money, the real wealth however is not in the cash but the reputation.  </p>

  <p>I was heading up the old grimy escalators of BART when a particularly piece of public art spang into view, which implanted the vision that lead to this entire project.</p>

  <p>All I had was a blueprint in my head. I imagined an interactive Google map documenting a sprawl of public art in the Bay Area. From big commissioned pieces laid out on a 5 story building to a tiny sticker on a post in West Oakland, the image was there, I just had no idea where to start.

I do have aspirations to build this out in future, such as adding some methods for filtering desired metrics, user submissions and such.  If you think this is a cool project and you want to contribute please feel free to fork the Github and support open source! It would be great to see this thing blossom into a full scale public art repository in the Bay Area. üèô</p>
