  <p>Graffiti is a glimpse into the life of an artist, one that is often not recognized, has no face, nor museum exhibits. They leave in the dead of night, there are no rules, the only thing between them and the wall is the flashing lights of a police car, otherwise the world is their canvas. Graf<span class="blue">¬∑</span>fi<span class="red">¬∑</span>ti a term rooted in the word <i>graffio</i> or ‚Äòa scratch‚Äô, is a nice euphemism to explain the phenomenon of someone who works a graveyard shift doing something they love while not getting paid,  in an environment often fueled by adrenaline, which offers dangers such as detainment and death. Did I mention that they love what they do?   </p>

   The self awareness of this irony is killing me . . .

  <p >It‚Äôs a game of cat and mouse. Get caught, spend 100 hours in community service or five years in a state prison. <i>Run free</i> and you can relish in the thought of what you just created. If you're good enough it can stay for sometime, however is that the desired outcome?  </p>

  <p >Life is short and all I had was a blueprint in my head. I imagined an interactive map documenting a sprawl of public art in the Bay Area. From big commissioned pieces laid out on a 5 story building to a tiny sticker on a post in West Oakland, the image was there, I just had no idea where to start.

In the meantime, if you think this is a cool project and you want to contribute please feel free to <a class="rainbow" href="https://github.com/MorkWood2/Public_Art_Map">fork</a> the Github and support open source!

    <p class="outro ">My reflection is two fold. What I learned from the art and what I learned from the creative coding process. I‚Äôll start with the art. In my observations I found that the artwork often preserved local memories and gave a unique insight into the culture, values, and struggles of the surrounding neighborhoods. Much like a foggy mirror the art reflected an identity. For example the Tenderloin was just about the only place in which the art echoed struggle, poverty, incarceration, and drugs. Chinatown for instance, stayed true with the asian imagery and Chinese script. Haight street paid respects and tributes to the 60‚Äôs bohemian cultures.  Large commissioned pieces were often in denser city centers, whereas alley ways were a perfect canvas for the anonymous artist.</p>

    <p class="outro ">Perhaps the most challenging part of the whole process was just keeping it simple, not just in the user interface but the Javascript as well.  I found that asking feedback in how I arranged the data caught some bugs that would have been a headache to debug down the line. All in all this exercise, if you can call it that,  was a success. If you made it this far you rock. If you have any questions feel free to message me on <a class="rainbow" href="https://twitter.com/MorkWood">twitter</a>. ü§ñ</p>
